<h1> React Todo List App with Redux</h1>

This is a Todo List app built using React.js and Redux for state management. The app allows you to create, edit, and delete tasks, as well as mark them as completed or incomplete.

The app features a modern and user-friendly interface, with drag-and-drop functionality for rearranging tasks. It also includes filtering options to help you organize your tasks by priority, status, or due date.

This app is a great starting point for anyone interested in learning how to build React apps with Redux. It includes comprehensive documentation and can be easily customized and extended to fit your specific needs.
